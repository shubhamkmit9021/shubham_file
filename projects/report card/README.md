# Evaluation Report Card

## [Deployed link](https://evaluation-report-card.netlify.app/)

- This is designed to generate a report card for students. 

- In this, I set the passing criteria as 50%.

- This is also a responsive layout, but the best user experience is on the desktop or tab.

- For that I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design it.
