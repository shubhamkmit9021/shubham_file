# Products Inventory

## [Deployed link](https://products-add-inventory.netlify.app/)

- In this project, we can perform various operations like adding and deleting products...

- when we add products total price increases and when we delete the price will decrease...

- This is also a responsive layout, but the best user experience is on the desktop or tab.

- I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design it.
